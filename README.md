This is a change calculator: 

If you put in the amount something costs, and the total amount of cash used to pay for it, 
it will return how many dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies are needed to 
be given as change. 

To load it, pull the repository in its entirety, open the index.html file in the browser
of your choice. Alternatively if npm/node are installed you may type $npm start into 
your Command Line and visit the site on the local host address it gives you.
